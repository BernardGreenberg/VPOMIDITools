<h1>BSG VPO system changes log</h1>
<h1>Reverse-chronological by “<tt>insreg</tt> distro” ##</h1>

<dl>
  <dt>1.0.12</dt>
  <dd><ul>
    <li>(20 Apr 2020) Fixes a bug in 1.0.11 time-signature embedding
  fix.  Rather than crash, it would produce a <span
  class="smc">MIDI</span> that would cause the VPO to output an
    infinite note.</li>
    </ul>
    </dd>
  <dt>1.0.11</dt>
 <dd> <ul>
   <li>(10 Apr 2020) A bug which caused <tt>insreg</tt> to fail with a
   message about out-of-order events when a time-signature change
   occurs within a composition was fixed.  This bug did not
   occur when <tt>-O</tt> (old conversion code) was used.  It is hard
   to believe that the new code had not encountered a time-signature
   change until now, yet, so it must be.</li>
   
   <li>(7 Oct 2019) Elimination of zero-length notes.  MuseScore creates these as
  part of its solution to the &ldquo;unison collision&rdquo; problem.
  They occur when two identical notes overlap, such as a soprano and
  alto coinciding in closed-score (being used as input to a VPO application).
  Until now, <tt>insreg</tt> passed these through to the VPO
  applications, both of which seemed to handle them properly, i.e.,
  ignore them, but they do cause problems when the <span
  class="smc">MIDI</span> file is read back into MuseScore. And they
  just don&rsquo;t belong there. In verbose mode, the activity is
  traced; otherwise, its result is summarized.</li>
  
  <li>(7 Oct 2019). The <tt>phraseit</tt> facility should not be used
  for new work.  It was designed as a remedy for the lack of easy phrasing in
  MuseScore, which latter is now available via the <a
  href="https://musescore.org/en/project/articulation-and-ornamentation-control">MuseScore
  Articulation Plugin</a> starting with MuseScore 3.3.  Directly
  imparting phrasing to the score with this tool is highly preferable to
  and easier than <tt>phraseit</tt>.
  </li>

</ul></dd>

<dd>  <ul>
   <li>Support for Piotr Grabowski's &ldquo;Green Positiv&rdquo;, under 
                   both Grand Orgue and Hauptwerk, added.  Support
                   for the Hauptwerk free-demo organ,
                   St. Anne&rsquo;s at Moseley, England, has been added.</li>
   <li>(Grand Orgue only). The optional <b>PrologueExpectedName</b>
   header statement has been added to verify correspondence of
   an <b>orgdef</b> with its prologue
   file. See <a href="orgdef.html#Initialization">this documentation.</a></li>
   <li>The <b>orgdef</b> model has
  been repaired so that parameterization of control classes works
  properly.  Thus, either of <tt>StopModel:&nbsp;CommonSwitch1</tt> or
  <tt>StopModel:&nbsp{Name:&nbsp;CommonSwitch, Channel:&nbsp;1}</tt>
  is now usable in Hauptwerk <b>orgdef</b>s.</li></ul></dd>
  <dd><ul><li>(Hauptwerk only) The Hauptwerk <b>orgdef</b> model has been enhanced to support a new <b>StopModel</b>, 
  <b>CommonSwitch1</b>, signifying a <b>CommonSwitch</b> sent to 
  <span class="smc">MIDI</span> Channel 1.  In fact, <p></p>
  <ul class="uli">
    <li>The <tt>Channel</tt> parameter of <b>CommonSwitch</b>
    [didn&rsquo;t] work and [was] difficult to fix.
    Piotr Grabowski&rsquo;s Giubiasco was accepting the 0 falsely 
    sent instead of 1 (hence, the bug was masked), but
  (Hauptwerk&rsquo;s free sample) St. Anne (and probably others) do not.</li>

    <li>All three known instruments with <b>CommonSwitch</b> stop control (two from Grabowski and 
    St. Anne) expect the commands on channel 1, not 0</li>
  </ul>
  <b>CommonSwitch1</b> should be used if <span class="smc">MIDI</span> inspection reveals use 
  of channel 1 (which is expected) for stop control.</li></ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>1.0.10 (Frozen 7 Jan 2019)</dt>
  <dd><ul>
    <li><span class="smc">YAML</span> has been privately patched to diagnose
  duplicate keys (e.g., <tt>m+b</tt> in schedules, division names in schedule
  actions, stops in orgdefs) via the standard <span
  class="smc">YAML</span> error mechanism (whose errors the tools “catch” and
    present cleanly).  The otherwise lack of such diagnosis is a
  <span class="smc">YAML</span> bug.  Tested with <span
  class="smc">YAML</span> 3.11, but probably works with 3.12 (current).</li>
    <li><tt>insreg</tt>’s handling of <span
  class="smc">YAML</span> errors has been improved slightly (<tt>phraseit</tt>
  was already good). <tt>insreg</tt> will also now diagnose a nonexistent input file “cleanly”
  (i.e., no stack trace). This and other usage errors deemed to not be
  “registration errors” <i>per se</i> will now be
  reported as <tt>"Insreg usage error".</tt></li>
    <li><tt>insreg</tt> “unison collision” handling has been enhanced to
  discard redundant <tt>NoteOn</tt>s as well as premature
  <tt>NoteOff</tt>s.  While the VPO apps ignore the former,
  discarding them contributes to making the converted organ score
  importable for inspection.  Console messages about unison handling
  have been generalized to cover this.</li>
  <li>(Hauptwerk only; Grand Orgue already “merges down” to one
  track.) <tt>insreg</tt> will now output as many tracks as divisions
  that are used (plus one for the “conductor” track, i.e., control/timing), all events in
  each track bearing the corresponding division’s channel number. They will be
  ordered by descending channel number, causing the track layout
  (as it were!) to parallel the
  vertical layout of manuals and pedals.  The previous policy of
  selectively retained tracks corresponding to MuseScore staves has
  been wholly discarded. (This affects only the track organization of
  the output file, not the meaning of <tt>RouteStaves</tt> or similar.)</li>
  <li>Some gratuitously prolix displays of per-track events have been
  eliminated from <tt>insreg</tt>.  A final listing of the
  “re-organized” tracks (tracks about to
  be written to the file, whether or not suppressed by <tt>-c</tt>)
  will still be produced at the end of its run.</li>
  <li>Orgdef: Attempts to define multiple divisions with the
  same channel (only possible in Version 3) will be
  diagnosed. This and other organ definition errors will now show
  prefixed <tt>"Organ definition error:"</tt>.</li>
  <li><p style="padding-bottom: 0px">A new <tt>insreg</tt> option, <b>NoPrologue</b>, suppresses the
  prologue in the output <span class="smc">MIDI</span> file for both Hauptwerk and Grand Orgue.  It
  specifically allows a registration to be set
  up by hand, perhaps through human performance, and subsequently tried with the
  prepared <span class="smc">MIDI</span> file without “clearing” the
  organ. This can be useful while experimenting with registrations for
  a piece. You may need</p>
  <pre style="padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; margin-top:0 px;
  margin-bottom: 0px;">
  Registration: { }
  </pre>
  when, as a result, you have no registrations or schedule
  (although you might reasonably still need the latter for manual changes).  It
  works properly for Hauptwerk, but for
  Grand Orgue, omission of the prologue, as far as is known, evokes
  incorrect operation. The new option facilitates research into that problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forcible opening of all swell-pedals of enclosed divisions is
  in this regard part of the prologue; if you specify <b>NoPrologue</b>, it
  <i>will not be done</i>.  As with a real console, check and open
  all swell pedals before performing (no crescendo-pedal yet).  Forwarned is forearmed.
  </li>
  <li><tt>insreg -k (--kombination)</tt> was broken (crashed); fixed.</li>
  <li><b>SourcePath</b> is no longer required in phrasing files when
  only used with <tt>insreg</tt> (i.e., not <tt>phraseit</tt>
  directly).  Also, if the <tt>MidiPath</tt> command line argument
  to <tt>phraseit</tt> is used, <b>SourcePath</b> is not
  required.</li>
  <li><tt>dumpmidi</tt> no longer special-cases Time Signature events,
  no longer displaying them in a format different from other Meta-Events,
  nor in <tt>--brief (-b)</tt> mode.  You can always infer all Time
  Signature events from the Time Model, which is always shown.</li>
  <li>Orgdef: <b>Yes</b> is now acceptable as a division
  <b>Expression</b> target, meaning that the division is enclosed,
  and its swell pedal is on the division’s channel, which is the usual
  case, avoiding the mysterious self-reference heretofore.</li>
  <li>Orgdef: a new <b>DefaultP1</b> division attribute (in Version 3)
  allows per-division override/default of per-instrument default for
  stop address <tt>P1</tt>’s.  Some instruments are laid out this way.</li>
  <li>Orgdef: support for Hauptwerk instruments that use
  <tt>ControlChange</tt> <span class="smc">MIDI</span> commands and
  not <tt>SysEx</tt>. See <a href="orgdef.html#hwaltcc">this section.</a></li>
