# VPOMIDITools

Copyright Â© 2016-2020 Bernard Greenberg -- GNU GPL Version 3

These are python-coded tools for preparing and customizing MIDI files for Hauptwerk/GrandOrgue VPO's (virtual pipe organs).  Each organ to be used must have a definition file within this system. I have created them for several popular instruments digitized and prepared by Sonus Paradisi and Piotr Grabowski (as well as Hauptwerk's St. Anne, Moseley).  I provide instructions for supporting others, but will not do it for you.

These tools are posted and offered under the terms of the GNU General Public License Version 3. See the file LICENSE for details. No warranty, guarantee of operability or suitability for any purpose is made or implied, and use is at your risk -- all the code is visible here for inspection.

After downloading or cloning the repository, please open index.html to learn more (the html file cannot be viewed properly unless its style-sheet bsgmiditoools.css is present).

Python version 3 is required.  The pyyaml (YAML) package must also be installed.  Instructions are given in the documentation just cited.
